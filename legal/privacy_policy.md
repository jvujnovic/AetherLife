## 1. Information We Collect

We do not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information (PII) from users.

However, the App may collect anonymous technical and behavioral data such as:

We also collect anonymous usage data through Firebase Analytics, including:

- Feature usage (e.g., New Game started, Dice used)
- User interaction events (e.g., open full-screen, create playmat)

## 2. Third-Party Services

The App uses the following third-party services to enhance functionality:

- **Scryfall API**: Used to search and display Magic: The Gathering card information. No personal data is sent to Scryfall.

- **Google AdMob**: Displays banner ads. AdMob may collect non-personal data, including the device’s advertising ID (GAID or IDFA), to serve personalized or contextual ads. You can opt out of personalized ads via your device settings.

- **Firebase Analytics**: Used to understand user interaction with the App. Data collected is aggregated and anonymous.

Note: While we do not collect personal data ourselves, these third-party services may collect identifiers such as the Advertising ID for ad delivery and analytics purposes.

We do not sell personal data. Users may opt out of any data sharing for targeted ads by adjusting ad personalization settings on their device.
