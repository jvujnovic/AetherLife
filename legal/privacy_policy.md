## 1. Information We Collect

We do not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information (PII) from users.

However, the App may collect anonymous technical and behavioral data such as:
- Crash reports
- App performance analytics
- Device type, OS version, general usage patterns
- Advertising ID (used for ad personalization or frequency capping)
- Other device identifiers (e.g., Android ID, IDFA) as required by third-party advertising SDKs

We also collect anonymous usage data through Firebase Analytics, including:
- Screen views (e.g., GameScreen, SettingsScreen, CardSearchScreen)
- Feature usage (e.g., New Game started, Dice used)
- User interaction events (e.g., open full-screen, create playmat)

## 2. Third-Party Services

The App uses the following third-party services to enhance functionality:

- **Scryfall API**: Used to search and display Magic: The Gathering card information. No personal data is sent to Scryfall.

- **Google AdMob**: Displays banner ads. AdMob may collect non-personal data, including the device’s advertising ID (GAID or IDFA), to serve personalized or contextual ads. You can opt out of personalized ads via your device settings.

- **Meta Audience Network**: Used to display ads through mediation. Meta Audience Network may collect device identifiers (such as the Advertising ID, Android ID, IDFA, or other device information) to deliver ads, limit ad frequency, detect fraud, and measure ad performance. For more details, see the [Meta Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy).

- **ironSource (LevelPlay Mediation)**: Used to manage and serve ads from multiple ad networks. ironSource may collect device identifiers (such as Advertising ID, Android ID, IDFA) to deliver ads, perform frequency capping, detect fraud, and measure ad performance. For more details, see the [ironSource Privacy Policy](https://developers.is.com/ironsource-mobile/air/ironsource-mobile-privacy-policy/).

- **Firebase Analytics**: Used to understand user interaction with the App. Data collected is aggregated and anonymous.

Note: While we do not collect personal data ourselves, these third-party services may collect device identifiers (such as Advertising ID, Android ID, IDFA, or other device IDs) for ad delivery, analytics, and fraud prevention.

This app uses Magic: The Gathering content under [Wizards of the Coast’s Fan Content Policy](https://company.wizards.com/en/legal/fancontentpolicy).  
This app is not affiliated with, endorsed by, sponsored by, or specifically approved by Wizards of the Coast.

## 4. How We Use Collected Information

Both Google AdMob, Meta Audience Network, and ironSource respect your device-level ad personalization settings. If you opt out of personalized ads, only non-personalized ads will be shown.

We do not sell personal data. Users may opt out of any data sharing for targeted ads by adjusting ad personalization settings on their device.
